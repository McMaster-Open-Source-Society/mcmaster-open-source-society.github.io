# McMaster Open Source Society (MOSS)

Welcome to the official GitHub of McMaster Open Source Society (MOSS), a student-driven initiative to support collaborative, real-world software development within the McMaster community.

## About Us
MOSS is a casual, remote-friendly student group that encourages McMaster students to engage with open source tools and workflows. Whether you're fixing bugs, writing documentation, or building tools from scratch, this is a space to collaborate, learn, and build a public record of your work.

We focus on:
- Contributing to real open source repositories
- Hosting beginner-friendly workshops and events
- Running student-led projects
- Helping members build their GitHub and technical presence
